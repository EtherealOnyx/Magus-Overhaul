# Magus-Overhaul

Magus Overhaul is a mod by EtherealOnyx that adds a magical aspect to the game.
It overhauls many systems like the potion system, combat system, and control system to achieve stunning gameplay visuals.
It also adds a specialized spell casting system with several types of elemental damage.
One of my first mods, so expect there to be several bugs!

# Spell-Casting System

This system would be a little similar to that of a previously known mod named Ars Magica, or a more recent one named Psi, 
in terms of the flexibility it allows you to have.
Each spell is going to require a casting type (projectile, aoe, marked target, self, lock-on, etc), 
spell type (damage, weaken, stun, knockdown, aerial, knockback, heal, etc),
and special modifiers (invert, effectiveness increase, speed, etc).
This will most definitely be improved and changed over the course of this mod's lifetime.

# Potion System
The easiest way to add an effect to an entity would be through the use of potion effects. This is where most of the effects will be
coming from. However, they will be extended from potions to differentiate in certain ways - one, they can't be dispelled normally,
two, they show their effects differently, and three, they won't be able to be used explicitly with the /effect command.

# Combat System
Another addition would be the concept of mana and elemental runes that will be needed to cast certain types of spells.
Like the burnout system of Ars Magica 2, there will be penalties for spamming a spell - in a much different way, however. Cooldowns
will be added to spells themselves, and this will create an interesting effect in gameplay. Similar spells (two spells,
like a projectile - heal spell and a self - heal spell will share a cooldown, to prevent a player from having too many of the same spell,
avoiding the system completely). Cooldown will be determined of the spell type, along with the mana cost and rune cost.

# Control System
The combat system would eventually introduce a new mode similar to 3rd person view but a little more outwards to allow for a wider FoV.
Not only this, but the strafeability will also be improved immensely as it doesn't seem 
quite possible to strafe around a mob/boss quite easily yet.
Not only that, but by pressing a hotkey, the vanilla minecraft hotbar will be replaced by RPG-styled bar where people will be able
to place their spells that they customized themselves.
